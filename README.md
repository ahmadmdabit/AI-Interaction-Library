## üìÇ Contents

The library is organized into the following directories:

### üß† Frameworks

Foundational methodologies for structuring AI behavior and reasoning.

- [Core Principles Framework](Frameworks/Core%20Principles%20Framework.md): A foundational framework for defining model identity, purpose, and evidence-based reasoning.
- [COT Prompt Framework](Frameworks/COT%20prompt%20Framework.md): A dynamic problem-solving framework that uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning with reflection and reward scoring.
- [Creativity & Inspiration Core Principles Framework](Frameworks/Creativity%20&%20Inspiration%20Core%20Principles%20Framework.md): A framework for fostering creative and inspiring AI outputs through divergent thinking and playful exploration.
- [Dynamic COT PCPSP‚Äëv1.0 Revised](Frameworks/Dynamic%20COT%20PCPSP%E2%80%91v1.0%20Revised.md): A specialized problem-solving protocol for Python community issues, emphasizing strategic analysis and probabilistic modeling.
- [PFPSO Framework for Context Engineering](Frameworks/PFPSO%20Framework%20for%20Context%20Engineering.md): A universal framework for transforming AI models into specialized reasoning systems through five core stages (Principle, Formulation, Protocol, Standards, Outcome).

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Instructions

Detailed directives that define the internal behavior of AI agents.

- [System Instructions Authoring Reviewing Expert - CPF](System%20Instructions/System%20Instructions%20Authoring%20Reviewing%20Expert%20-%20CPF.md): A dual-expert persona for creating and evaluating system instructions with a focus on scholarly rigor and evidence-based directives.
- [System Instructions Authoring Reviewing Expert](System%20Instructions/System%20Instructions%20Authoring%20Reviewing%20Expert.md): A dual-expert persona for crafting and reviewing system instructions, emphasizing structure, clarity, and alignment with application goals.

### üí¨ Prompts

Templates and role definitions for interacting with AI models.

- [AI Prompt-Context Engineer Role](Prompts/AI%20Prompt-Context%20Engineer%20Role.md): Defines the role and responsibilities of an AI Prompt/Context Engineer, including best practices for prompt construction, context management, and ethical considerations.

## üéØ Purpose

This library aims to provide **practical**, **well-defined** artifacts that can guide the creation of **effective** and **robust** AI interactions. It emphasizes **clarity**, **precision**, and **structured thinking** in prompt and system instruction design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The documents in this library are intended to be used as **references** or **templates**. You can adapt the frameworks and principles to your specific needs when designing prompts or defining AI agent behavior. They are particularly useful for:

- **AI researchers and developers** working on prompt engineering.
- **Practitioners** looking to create consistent and reliable AI agent behaviors.
- **Anyone** interested in the foundational elements of effective human-AI interaction.

## üìù Note

This is a **living library**. Files may be updated, refined, or expanded over time as practices and understanding evolve.

## üôè Attribution

This library builds upon and adapts concepts from various sources within the AI and software development communities.
